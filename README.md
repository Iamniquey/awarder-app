# Welcome to the Awarder App

## About this app

This app was created by me Niquey Ree to serve my English learning students. It is to encourage their usage of particular grammar and vocabulary in class. I award them points for every encourged activity and display their final score at the end of class.

If you would like to use this app, it is available for free [here](app.iamniquey.com/awarder).

Feel free to fork and modify this app to your taste.

## Installation

Run `npm i` in the terminal to install dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to launch the development version in your browser.
